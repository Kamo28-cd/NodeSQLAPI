# NodeSQLAPI
[NodeJS and SQLite Project] A very basic and simple NodeJS and SQLite API 

This is project is a basic API using NodeJS and SQLite. The purpose of which is
to allow a user the capability of doing basic CRUD operations with relational
databases. This project uses the Knex library in order to achieve this and
therefore allowing one to use SQLite when in development and later use large
scale relational databases such as MySQL and PosteSQL. A Schema for a basic table
is included you can add a migrational library to handle version control and migrations.

This code is only meant as a starter/boiler plate and will be expanded upon to include more
extensive API architecture.
